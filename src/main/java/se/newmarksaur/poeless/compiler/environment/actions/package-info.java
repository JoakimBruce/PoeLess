/**
 * <p>
 * A collection of objects representing the various actions, and related help classes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An <b>action</b> is a part of a block in a filter that specifies a behavior that
 * is to be displayed when the conditions are met. Such an action can be setting a font size,
 * setting the color for a specific part of the component, or playing a sound. <b>Note:</b> even
 * though <i>show</i>/<i>hide</i> is placed in the beginning of a block in the normal PoE-filter
 * syntax, it is considered an action statement for the purpose of this parser.
